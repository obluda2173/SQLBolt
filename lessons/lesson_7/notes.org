* SQL Lesson 7 - OUTER JOINs
In SQL JOINs let you combine rows from 2 tables based on column related to both of the tables.

The 4 main types are:
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- FULL JOIN

Table *employees*

| emp_id | name    | dept_id |
|--------+---------+---------|
|      1 | Alice   |       1 |
|      2 | Bob     |       2 |
|      3 | Charlie |  (NULL) |
|      4 | Diana   |       3 |

Table *departments*

| dept_id | dept_name   |
|---------+-------------|
|       1 | Engineering |
|       2 | Sales       |
|       3 | HR          |
|       4 | Marketing   |

** INNER JOIN
Returns only rows *where there is a match* in both tables

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name FROM employees AS e
INNER JOIN departments AS d
   ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
#+END_SRC

Result:
| name  | dept_name   |
|-------+-------------|
| Alice | Engineeting |
| Bob   | Sales       |
| Diana | HR          |

Charlie is expluded as his dept_id is NULL

** LEFT JOIN
Returns all rows from the left table (employees), pkus mathced rows from the right table. Unmatched tight-side colums become NULL

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name FROM employees AS e
LEFT JOIN departments AS d
  ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
#+END_SRC

Result:
| name    | dept_name   |
|---------+-------------|
| Alice   | Engineering |
| Bob     | Sales       |
| Charlie | (NULL)      |
| Diana   | HR          |

Charlie will appear with NULL dept_name because there is no matching dept_id

** RIGHT JOIN
Returns *all rows from the right table* (departments), plus matched rows from the left table. Unmatched left-side colums become NULL

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name FROM employees AS e
RIGHT JOIN departments AS d
  ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
#+END_SRC

Result:
| name   | dept_name   |
| Alice  | Engineering |
| Bob    | Sales       |
| Diana  | HR          |
| (NULL) | Marketing   |

"Marketing" appears with NULL name because no employee is in that dept
** FULL JOIN
Returns *all rows from both tables*. Where thereâ€™s no match on one side, columns are NULL.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees AS e
FULL OUTER JOIN departments AS d
  ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
#+END_SRC

Result:
| name    | dept_name   |
|---------+-------------|
| Alice   | Engineering |
| Bob     | Sales       |
| Charlie | (NULL)      |
| Diana   | HR          |
| (NULL)  | Marketing   |

Combines the unmatched rows from both tables
