#+title: SQL Lesson 11: Queries with aggregates (Pt. 2)

It can be noticed that when the *GROUP BY* clause is being executed after the *WHERE* clause (which filters the rows which are to be grouped) then comes the question - "then how do we filter the groups themselves?"

Luckily, SQL forsaw this problem and added an additional clause *HAVING* that is particularly being used in combination with *GROUP BY* clause

Select query with *HAVING* constraint
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT group_by_column, AGG_FUNC(column_expression) AS aggregate_result_alias, â€¦
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING group_condition;
#+END_SRC

The *HAVING* clause constraint is written the same as the *WHERE*, but is applied only to the goups
