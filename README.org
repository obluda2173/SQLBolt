* Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the [[https://sqlbolt.com][SQLBolt]] interactive SQL tutorials.

Although SQLBolt includes a built-in SQL runner, I opted to work in Emacs with SQLite and Org-mode to gain a more hands-on understanding of SQL and enhance my proficiency in navigation and note-taking within my development environment.

* Topics Covered

- SELECT statements
- Filtering with WHERE
- GROUP BY and aggregate functions
- JOINs (INNER, LEFT, etc.)
- Subqueries and nested SELECTs
- Table modifications: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER

* Structure

- =movies.db= - SQL database used for testing queries
- =init.sql= - .sql file used to create and initialise the database
- =queries.sql= - another .sql file used to run the queries on database
- =notes.org= - .org file to store my notes on SQL

* Setup

Install SQLite (or make sure its installed):

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
brew install sqlite3     # macOS
#+END_SRC

To open the database:

#+begin_src shell
sqlite3 movies.db
#+end_src

To run queries (inside SQLite):

#+begin_src shell
.read queries.sql
#+end_src

* What I learned

- Writing and organizing SQL queries
- Navigating multi-table relationships using JOINs
- Query planning and stepwise decomposition with CTEs
- Clean, repeatable workflow combining SQLite and Emacs
